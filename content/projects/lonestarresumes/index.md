This resume builder lets you input data to create a resume. A live preview is generated as you type, so you can see how it should look when you download it. 

Currently, it's completely free. You don't even have to create an account down build and download your resume. But you will have to create an account if you want to save your resumes so you can come back and edit them later. 

Like most of my projects, the goal was to explore some new (to me) technologies. I wanted to build a react frontend that strictly used hooks. And specifically I wanted to use the useContext and useReducer hooks together to sort of mimic Redux. 

I also wanted to use Serverless Framework and create something with a completely serverless backend. 

Overall the frontend was by far the biggest part, the backend is comparatively simple. 

I plan on writing a few blog posts going over what I learned in more detail.
