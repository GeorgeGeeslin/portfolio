Hi, I'm George Geeslin and if you reading this then you're on my blog. I'm not sure what brought you here, but I hope that you'll find something useful.

I'm a web developer, so that's what I'll be writing about. Mostly about things I've built and challenges I encountered along the way, maybe the odd tutorial here or there. Truthfully, I'm doing this for myself. The goal is to become a better developer. There are lots of [articles](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/if-youre-a-developer-you-should-start-blogging-and-here-s-why-b5cb2951d95c) on the internet about why [blogging](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf) is good for developers.

I'll also be displaying some personal projects on this site over on the Projects pages.

I'll suppose that's all for now, but expect some more interesting things in the future.

Hello world, nice to meet you.
